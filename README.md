#RentMe

*Work in Progress*
A small web app that allows users to enter a Vancouver, BC address to find the suitable rental price for that property. The project uses **Scrapy** to implement web crawlers that gather data from existing rental listings and **scikit-learn** Machine Learning library to calculate and predict rental price.
